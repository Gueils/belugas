# This file lists all the engines available to be run for analysis.
#
# Each engine must have `channels` (with a `stable` key) and `description`. The
# values in `channels` will be passed to `docker run` and so may be any value
# appropriate for that (repo/name:tag, image id, etc).
#
# When a repo has files that match the `enable_regexps`, that engine will be
# enabled by default in the codeclimate.yml file. That file will also have in it
# the `default_ratings_paths` globs, which are used during analysis to determine
# which files should be rated.
